# Welcome to MSDS-6373-Time-Series!  
Here is the one stop shop for ppts, docs and other materials related to the course!

The readings for each Unit will be on the ReadMe Page for each Unit's folder.   

There is a quite a bit of mathematical detail in these chapters that will be good for students to be exposed to.  However, mathematically, students are only responsible (as far as testing is concerned) for the details that are also covered in the videos or that we specifically cover in Live Session.

You will also find the HW and the HW solutions for the Unit in the folder.  It is assumed that everyone has completed and understands the solution to each of these problems.  The midterm will be compiled largely of problems similar to these.  If you have questions, post them on the Wall and/or on your Powerpoint deck for live session.  You may occasionally find a mistake in the solutions, I am compilling an errata as we go, please let me know if you think you have found a dicrepancy.  

OFFICE HOURS: MONDAY 9pm CENTRAL  

Have a blast! Remember this is Karate Kid Style!!!
