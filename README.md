# MSDS-6373-Time-Series
Here is the one stop shop for ppts, docs and other materials related to the course!

The readings for each unit will be on the ReadMe Page for each Unit's folder.  
You will also find the HW and the HW solutions for the Unit in the folder.  It is assumed that everyone has completed and understands the solution to each of these problems.  The midterm will be compiled largely of problems similar to these.  If you have questions, post them on the Wall and/or on your Powerpoint deck for live session.  You may occasionally find a mistake in the solutions, I am compilling an errata as we go, please let me know if you think you have found a dicrepancy.  

Have a blast! Remember this is Karate Kid Style!!!
