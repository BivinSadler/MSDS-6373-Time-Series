# Final Exam Review Materials!
It is not required to attend this session but please do if you have the time!

In this folder you will find:

1.  A review powerpoint that we will go over in live session.  Please prepare your answers and we wiill share them in breakout and then go over the solution in live session!  

2.  The actual in class final from Summer 2019 with the solution.  I recommend studying and then taking this test before you look at the solution.  **VERY IMPORTANT:**  Knowing all the solutons on **this** test will not be sufficient to do well on the exam.  There is no way to test all the methods and informaiton we covered throughout the course in a 1.5 hour test.  While there will be some overlap, there will be questions / concepts on the Summer 2020 final that were not tested in the Summer 2019 final.  

This is the finale!!!  Keep up the good work!  Finish strong!
