# Parameter Estimation and Model ID for Stationary Data

## Required Reading For Unit 9

### Estimation:

7.1 Introduction  

The next two sections are fairly mathematical.  It is not necessary to fully grasp all the math, I just want you to be exposed to how it works.  These readings go well with the videos.    
7.2.1.1 up to Equation (7.6)  
7.2.1.3 up to Equation (7.18)  

7.6  Close attention here.   

### Identification:

8.1  
8.2  
8.2.1  


## Errata

9.5.4 The matching definitions are off for the YW and the ML estimates.  They should be switched.  The ML method is the iterative method.    
9.9.4 n is missing thus the AIC calculation cannot be made.  Simply use the answer provided.
