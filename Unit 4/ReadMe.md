This is the ReadMe for Unit 4!

Suggested Reading
Hi Class! 

I am getting the readings out late this week thus these will be "Suggested Reading" and I will not test on anything covered in the reading that was not covered in the videos.  To that end, a lot of the Suggested Reading is examples.
Here it is!  It can also be found on the GitHub site for Unit 4.
