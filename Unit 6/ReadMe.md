1. 6.4 card 4: none of the answer choices match the output from R.  The answer is ARMA(4,2).
2. There is a 'B' missing in the model specification in the MA part of 6.6 Card 2 and 3
3. In 6.6 Card 2: The there is a B missing, please do not take the second difference (mistake on my part) and  
then choose the most favored by the aic from the choices that are given. 
4. FOR LIVE SESSION: In question 3 of the For Live Session Assignment, the models are missing.  Just skip that question and I will ask a similar question in Live Session.  
5. 6.6 Card 6 the model should have a -B^4.
6. 6.6 Card 7 ... just get as close as you can to factors that match a particular s.
