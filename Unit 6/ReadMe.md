1. 6.4 card 4: none of the answer choices match the output from R.  The answer is ARMA(2,1).
2. There is a 'B' missing in the model specification in the MA part of 6.6 Card 2 and 3
3. In 6.6 Card 2: The there is a B missing, please do not take the second difference (mistake on my part) and  
then choose the most favored by the aic from the choices that are given. 
4. FOR LIVE SESSION: In question 3 of the For Live Session Assignment, the models are missing.  Just skip that question and I will ask a similar question in Live Session.  
5. 6.6 Card 6 the model should have a -B^4. Also .. change the answer choices to be s = 4 rather than "Quarterly Seasonal Model."

6. 6.6 Card 7 ... just get as close as you can to factors that match a particular s.   Also .. change the answer choices to be s = 4 rather than "Quarterly Seasonal Model."
7. 6.6 Card 3: "What do we know about the true stationary correlation structure of the model with the (1-B^12) removed?"  Take out the part about generating a realization.  
8. 6.5 Card 2: Assume a graduate program has 3 semesters a year and thus each semeester is 4 months long.  Assume that the number of emails a professor recieves is farily constant for most of the semester but tend to peak around the time of finals. If the number of emails the professor receives is recorded monthly, "Which model would be most appropriate for modeling the number of emails received each month?" Answer: s = 4
