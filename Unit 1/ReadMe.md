There is a very subtle error in 1.10 in the calculation of vxbar (the variance of the sample mean).  nlag should be 2013 rather than 1508.  I have changed in this in the slides on Github.  We will go over this in Live Session as well.  (FYI, I changed the data set I was using for this example which changed the sample size and that wasn't updated in the code before shooting the video... the data set should have 2015 observation but one is an NA so 2014 actual observations.)
