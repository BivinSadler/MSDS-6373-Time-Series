**Suggested Reading for Unit 1**  

The required reading for Unit 1 is:  
1.1 - 1.6.  
There is a quite a bit of mathematical detail in these chapters that will be good for students to be exposed to.  However, mathematically, students are only responsible (as far as testing is concerned) for the details that are also covered in the videos.
