#Rolling Window ASE Function
# series is the array of the series
# horizon is how far you want to predict into the future
# d is the order of the differencing: (1-B^)^d
# s is the order of the seasonality: (1-B^s)
# phis = order of the stationary AR term
# thetas = order of the invertible MA term

# It simply takes the given horizon and the model in the form of s,d,phis and 
# thetas and figures out how many windows it can create in the data (series) and then calculates the ASE for each window.  
#The output is the average off all the ASEs from each individual window.
